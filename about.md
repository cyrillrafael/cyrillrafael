<div class="about-page">

Cyrill Rafael Vasilyev (1992) is&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist born in&nbsp;Moscow, Russia, and based in&nbsp;The Hague, Netherlands. His painterly installations are characterised by&nbsp;large sizes, vibrant colours, and a&nbsp;stark, bare rendering of&nbsp;the materiality of&nbsp;the work, which often communicates a&nbsp;tactile quality and engages the viewers senses with a&nbsp;bold intensity.
<br/>

<br/>
His interest in&nbsp;the world&rsquo;s contemplative traditions leads him to&nbsp;address in&nbsp;his work the themes of&nbsp;cyclicity, embodiment, flux, death, transcendence and dream-like, conditional nature of&nbsp;human experience and human reality. &laquo;In&nbsp;my&nbsp;practice&nbsp;I strive to&nbsp;evoke the subtle, ephemeral realms that ebb, flow and glide through the upper registers of&nbsp;our sensorium.
<br/>

<br/>

The scintillating affectivity that defies our wake-centric habits of&nbsp;thought and reveals a&nbsp;deeper, more nebulous truth of&nbsp;what nourishes&nbsp;us and makes&nbsp;us feel alive.
<br/>

<br/>

With my&nbsp;work&nbsp;I hope to&nbsp;achieve a&nbsp;somatic, visceral response. I&nbsp;try to&nbsp;let the materiality of&nbsp;my&nbsp;medium speak, so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;draws forth our own physicality. Transparent vibrancy of&nbsp;matter&mdash; that forms our being and the multitude of&nbsp;ecologies we&nbsp;inhabit&mdash; unceasing, effervescent, generous. Our non-difference from it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;revelation.
<br/>

<br/>

My&nbsp;subject matter is&nbsp;informed by&nbsp;pareidolic imagery and a&nbsp;matrix of&nbsp;mythopoetic and everyday fascinations. I&nbsp;prefer to&nbsp;work with large surfaces which could be&nbsp;related to&nbsp;both as&nbsp;bodies and spaces in&nbsp;the context of&nbsp;the installation, and always strife to&nbsp;emphasise the character and qualities of&nbsp;the materials I&nbsp;use, and celebrate the gift of&nbsp;vision, which can open&nbsp;us in&nbsp;such profound ways to&nbsp;the realities we&nbsp;live&nbsp;in.&raquo;
