A bloom in emptiness obtains. A fire is lit upon the vast branching geometries of supersticial hyperspaces.
May the scintillating affectivity that defies our wake-centric habits of thought,
Be our guide to the non-difference from the transparent vibrancy of matter,
That forms our being and the multitude of ecologies we inhabit.
May this revelation be a somatic, visceral response,
Drawing forth our own physicality,
And reminding us of the gift of vision,
Which can open us in such profound ways to the realities we live in.
