# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  bio    : "
3 / 3

I evoke subtle realms, defying our habits of thought, revealing a truth that nourishes and enlivens. Through materiality, I hope for a visceral response, celebrating vision and our non-difference from the transparent vibrancy of matter. My work: pareidolic imagery, mythopoetic fascinations, large surfaces as bodies and spaces, emphasising material qualities."
